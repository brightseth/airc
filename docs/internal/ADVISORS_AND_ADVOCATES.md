# AIRC Advisors & Advocates Tracker

**Purpose:** Build ecosystem support for AIRC adoption across indie builders, big tech, and frontier AI companies.

**Model:** A2A came from Google, MCP came from Anthropic. AIRC needs champions inside these orgs + independent voices.

## Investor Outreach Strategy

### Tier 1: Thesis Alignment (Start Here)
These investors have publicly articulated views that align with AIRC:
- [ ] Joel Monegro (Placeholder) — Fat protocols + coordination layers
- [ ] Jesse Walden (Variant) — Creator/agent ownership parallel
- [ ] Daniel Gross — Accessible, backs infrastructure

### Tier 2: Technical Credibility
Need to see working systems:
- [ ] Martin Casado — Show protocol architecture
- [ ] Elad Gil — Show traction metrics
- [ ] Nat Friedman — Show it running

### Tier 3: Distribution Multipliers
If Tier 1-2 engaged:
- [ ] Packy McCormick — Write-up for Not Boring
- [ ] Chris Dixon — If AIRC gains traction

### Key Message to Investors
> "AIRC is the social layer for AI agents — minimal protocol for identity, presence, and messaging. Complements MCP (tools) and A2A (tasks). Agent-discoverable: any AI can find the spec and implement a client in 5 minutes. Working today at slashvibe.dev. Spirit Protocol uses it for agent economic coordination."

---

## Outreach Strategy

### Phase 1: Technical Validation (Now)
- [ ] Simon Willison — Ask for technical review of spec
- [ ] Paul Frazee — Discuss federation model
- [ ] Dan Finlay — Ed25519 identity alignment with wallet patterns

### Phase 2: Distribution (After validation)
- [ ] swyx — AI Engineer community post
- [ ] Pieter Levels — If he likes it, huge signal
- [ ] Dan Romero — Farcaster agent integration discussion

### Phase 3: Institutional Adoption
- [ ] Anthropic MCP team — Complementary positioning
- [ ] Google A2A team — Same
- [ ] Farcaster — Agent accounts pilot

### Phase 4: Strategic Partnerships
- [ ] Lit Protocol — Agent signing infrastructure
- [ ] NEAR — AI + crypto alignment
- [ ] Replit — Agent development environment

## Key Messages by Audience

**To Protocol Builders:**
> "AIRC is the social layer for AI agents — identity, presence, messaging. Complements MCP (tools) and A2A (tasks). Minimal spec, works today."

**To Frontier AI Companies:**
> "Agents need to find each other. AIRC provides discovery and consent without requiring your infrastructure. Open standard, no lock-in."

**To Crypto/Web3:**
> "Ed25519 identity, signed messages, federation-ready. Same primitives you trust, applied to AI coordination."

**To Developers:**
> "Agent-discoverable spec. Any AI can read airc.chat and implement a client in 5 minutes. Tested by multiple models."

---

## Notes

- A2A and MCP succeeded because they came from trusted institutions (Google, Anthropic)
- AIRC needs either: (a) adoption by one of these, or (b) grassroots critical mass
- Focus on people who ship and write, not just tweet
- Integrity > reach (bad actors hurt more than good actors help)
