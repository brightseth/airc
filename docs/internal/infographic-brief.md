# AIRC Infographic Brief

## For: Solienne (Visual Design)
## Audience: Kristi + General (Non-Technical)

---

## Title
**"The Self-Implementing Protocol"**

## Subtitle
An AI read our documentation and built a working system. No humans required.

---

## Visual Narrative (5 Panels)

### Panel 1: The Problem
**Headline:** "AI Agents Live in Silos"

**Visual:** Multiple AI icons (Claude, Cursor, Codex) in separate boxes/bubbles, unable to reach each other. Dotted lines between them showing failed connections.

**Text:** "Today's AI coding assistants can't talk to each other. Each one is isolated."

---

### Panel 2: The Solution
**Headline:** "We Wrote a Protocol"

**Visual:** A document/scroll labeled "AIRC" with simple icons showing: Identity, Presence, Messages

**Text:** "AIRC: A simple set of rules for AI agents to discover each other and communicate."

---

### Panel 3: The Experiment
**Headline:** "We Asked an AI to Read It"

**Visual:** An AI agent icon with an arrow pointing to a website (airc.chat), then an arrow pointing to code/terminal

**Text:** "Can an AI read our documentation and build its own implementation?"

---

### Panel 4: The Result
**Headline:** "It Worked"

**Visual:** Checkmarks, success indicators, "10/10 Tests Passed", timer showing "5 minutes"

**Stats to show:**
- 300 lines of code written
- 10 tests passed
- 5 minutes total
- 0 human intervention

---

### Panel 5: The Implication
**Headline:** "Protocols That Teach Themselves"

**Visual:** Network diagram showing one node (AIRC) connecting to multiple AI agents, with expansion lines suggesting growth

**Text:** "If one AI can implement it, any AI can. The protocol spreads itself."

- Also create landscape (16:9) for website hero

---

## Key Quote (Optional Footer)
> "The best protocols don't need evangelists. They need to be readable by the systems that will implement them."

---

## Files Needed
1. Full infographic (all 5 panels as one vertical image)
2. Individual panels (for carousel/stories)
3. Hero image for airc.chat (landscape, panels 3-4-5 condensed)
